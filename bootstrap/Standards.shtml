		<h1>Standards Alignment</h1>
      <p>Extra lessons are nice, but Math teachers don't <i>have</i> 25 hours of spare classtime to spend on new materials, no matter how good it might be.

      <p>That's why Bootstrap is aligned to Common Core Standards for Mathematics, covering most Functional and Algebraic standards across the Common Core from Grade 7 through Algebra 2. This alignment makes it possible to integrate Bootstrap into the classroom smoothly, using time you've already planned into your pacing guidelines or scope and sequence plans.
      
      <p>Bootstrap is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedgagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards.

      <p>Bootstrap also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6), 2 (grades 6-9), and 3 (grades 9-12); Bootstrap1 (the algebra-oriented first course) covers standards in levels 1 and 2, while Bootstrap2 goes deeper into computer science and covers more standards in levels 2 and 3.

            Bootstrap students are confronted with challenging problems, and use a problem-solving methodology known as the <i>Design Recipe</i> to solve them. The recipe teaches critical thinking, asking students to write down what they know and think through each step on their way to a solution.

            Teachers engage students in discussion about each step in the Design Recipe, asking them to explain how they move from one step to another. In addition, students are challenged to debug the code of others, not just by identifying programmatic flaws but by also identifying faulty reasoning.

            When Bootstrap students want their characters to move, to stay onscreen or collide with one another, they must first model that behavior mathematically. And since the programming language is purely algebraic, these models become the programs themselves!

            Bootstrap students look closely at worked-out examples before generalizing to a formula, as part of the Design Recipe. When working with the Circles of Evaluation, students consider the structure of arithmetic expressions as functions being composed on one another -- and this structure becomes the basis for their code.

            By practicing the Design Recipe repeatedly, students begin to discern the connection between multiple representations of functions. They notice patterns in the examples they write and contracts they derive.

          Testing is emphasized throughout Bootstrap.  Bootstrap1 drills black-box test cases (with tests written before corresponding code).

Students practice recognizing each of these basic data patterns in various problems, and learn how to nest these concepts to build richer data structures (advanced students can easily get to trees with this approach).  Bootstrap does not cover different linear data structures (lists versus arrays), preferring to emphasize how to design richer data structures from simple building blocks of structs and lists.
