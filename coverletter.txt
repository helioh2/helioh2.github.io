I am a software developer, researcher and professor, interested in working with software engineering in active and motivating teams. I have experience in development with Java for Web Applications, Python and front end Web technologies, and I am able to learn new technologies very fast. I alsoh ave a background on distributed systems and artificial intelligence, especially multi-agent systems and semantic technologies, from my academic research. I am currently a professor of higher education, teaching programming, software engineering, Web development, distributed artificial intelligence and semantic technologies. I am always excited to learn new programming languages, technologies, techniques and best practices of software development.
